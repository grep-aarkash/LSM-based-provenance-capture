In order to proceed with the tools for complete static analysis, the 
methodology is as follows:

1. Using a docker environment for this. 
2. There are in total 5 tools in total which are required for the complete 
analysis to be performed. 

The five tools are
1. Extractor - inserted in the compilation process and adds a pass to 
specifically dump the CFG representation that GCC creates and maintains.

2. Activity Diagrams - This is shipped with the above tool extractor.

3. PathExaminer - It finds the paths of the system, but, it requires manual
annotation in order to do so.

4. Callgraphs - extracts function call from a code base. It works one 
compilation unit at a time. Limited to static calls and does not track neither
calls though function pointers.
