The next step would be doing a similar analysis for the kernel version 5.x. Automating the technique to utilize the tools for the newer kernel version should be done. Georget et al.[3] provided a set of tools which when used, help in visualizing information flows, performing static analysis and finally getting to the results if any LSM hooks are missing. If we can automate this process for the future kernel versions, it will be a great contribution.

Another contribution can be analysing the different IDS utilizing LSMs in different forms such as Blare, Weir, Laminar and understanding how and why they differ if they are utilizing the same underlying mechanisms. Is it just about the implementation or is there more to offer?

Another interesting contribution would be to provide a formalism to show the second part. Currently, it's been shown through some ad-hoc techniques. If through some formalism we can show that if an anomaly does indeed exist then it has to show up on the graph otherwise it is not really an anomaly.
