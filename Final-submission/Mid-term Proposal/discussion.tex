\section{Discussion}
The first interesting discussion point is under-
standing the completeness-security gap if any. Cur-
rently, the DAGs are generated with respect to the
provenance data. However, this is not taking the
timing aspect into consideration. Provenance cap-
ture mechanisms currently are data related. The way
we can capture anomalies is by learning the data
pattern from previous immutable data. However, if
the attacker brings in the timing aspect, keeping the
data intact can that cause damage? It depends on
the application if data delays can cause harm.
Another interesting point to discuss would be the
completeness of information flows means that it
guarantees that all flows are being captured. So
you need to place hooks at the relevant places
which ensures that all information flow paths are
being recorded. However, again this does not cover
the event aspect of the system. What if instead of
modifying the data with alone or modifying the data
with respect to time, it modifies the event in a smart
way such that the correlations created by the DAG
cannot spot it. Instead of sending the data from
process P to process Q, it sends it to process R.
