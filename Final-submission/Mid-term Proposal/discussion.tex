\section{Future work}
The next step would be doing a similar analysis for the kernel version 5.x. Automating the technique to utilize the tools for the newer kernel version should be done. Georget et al.[3] provided a set of tools which when used, help in visualizing information flows, performing static analysis and finally getting to the results if any LSM hooks are missing. If we can automate this process for the future kernel versions, it will be a great contribution.

Another contribution can be analysing the different IDS utilizing LSMs in different forms such as Blare, Weir, Laminar and understanding how and why they differ if they are utilizing the same underlying mechanisms. Is it just about the implementation or is there more to offer?

If indeed every action we perform shows up in a provenance graph, we can use that information to recreate information. I do mention this in the paper, however, proceeding in that direction sounds interesting.

Another challenge would be to consider covert channels during the analysis.

I think health care could benefit a lot from such approaches. If we can have such concept in inside the human body, which creates a provenance of everything the body consumed. This is probably fiction for now, but maybe someday.
