\section{Conclusion}
Hence, finally we run the analysis which was introduced by Georget et al[3] for the version 4.3 and we find three system calls which call LSM hooks but not all paths are mediated. These are listed in table 4 and 5.

We further provide a formalism to show that if all the flows pass through LSM hooks,then the flows gets captured by CamFlow. If they get captured by CamFlow, and assuming that no data is lost during the construction of the graphs, all the anomalies show up in the graphs.
