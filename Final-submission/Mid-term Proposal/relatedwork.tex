There are many types of tools dedicated to the analysis of the kernel. The most basic method in order to find errors faster, is to look for reasons in the code known to be symptomatic of certain classes of problems. For example, to detect the omission of a deallocating memory in a function or a direct comparison between a
pointer and an integer. In response to this problem has been
developed Ladybug [ 28]. MECA [ 29 ] and CQUAL [ 30 ] are other tools which were developed for performing the static analysis of the kernel.
